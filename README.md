# [Mathematical Mathcards](http://mathcards.design-ninja.net)

##by: Kenny Scott

A simple, functioning Math Flashcards game, 

Future will bring:
 - Refactored code, this is kinda ugly, and probably not best practice.
 - Sound files that will speak the problem
 - Random images that will display if the answer is correct 
 - Many more sound effects (hearing the same ones gets boring)

Yes, I realize there is stuff like this out there, but this is catered to MY SON and his interests and learning style...everything out there is either ugly, complex or just distracting as hell.
